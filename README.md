## Abstract
Following a rubric, we added functionality to a website using JavaScript to interact with HTML and CSS.  The project shows randomized motivational posters using data from a set of given arrays; it allows the user to create their own motivational poster; and has a page that stores saved posters and displays them as thumbnails in a grid. 

## Wins
* Followed all pull-requests templates
* Gained more familiarity with the Git workflow process
* Set time boundaries and utilized pom breaks
* We reached out to mentors, rocks, and fellow cohort mates to collaborate
* Communication was clear
* Remained patient and kind with each other even through the most stressful moments

## Challenges
* Time zone was an extra obstacle, but it allowed us to collaborate intentionally and solo-study when needed
* Difficult navigating the project when resources (mentors, rocks, and peers) were tapped
* Tuple felt isolating at times when help was needed, and switching between that and the Zoom Study Hall became tidious
* Adapting to program time demands
